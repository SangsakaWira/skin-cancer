Baseline CNN Implementation : MobileNetV1

MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build lightweight deep neural networks.


Improvement: MobileNetV2

MobileNetV2 builds upon the ideas from MobileNetV1, using depthwise separable convolution as efficient building blocks. However, V2 introduces two new features to the architecture: 1) linear bottlenecks between the layers, and 2) shortcut connections between the bottlenecks1.
